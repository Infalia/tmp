```
$ php artisan key:generate

<h4>Public directory</h4>
After installing Laravel, you should configure your web server's document/web root to be the public directory. The index.php in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.

<h4>Permissions</h4>
Also, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the storage and the bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server or Laravel will not run.

After creating the project's database, you should run the command below to create the database tables and then import the demo database file tmp.sql to have some testing data.

```
$ php artisan migrate
