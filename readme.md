####Configuration variables
Rename the .env.example to .env and edit the applicationâ€™s configuration variables. You should also check if the APP_KEY variable has been generated. If not, you should run the command below, or your user sessions and other encrypted data will not be secure.

```
$ php artisan key:generate
```

####Public directory
After installing Laravel, you should configure your web server's document/web root to be the *public* directory. The index.php in this directory serves as the front controller for all HTTP requests entering your application.

####Permissions
Also, you may need to configure some permissions. Directories within the storage and the bootstrap/cache directories should be writable by your web server or Laravel will not run.

After creating the project's database, you should run the commands below to create the database tables and generate some dummy data.

$ php artisan migrate
$ php artisan db:seed
